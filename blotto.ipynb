A strategy that beats this can be created by copying this strategy, increasing the soldiers allocated to castle 10, and decreasing the soldiers allocated to some other castle. The only way this process fails is if all soldiers are allocated to castle 10, and this is easy to beat.\n",

On the face, this seems hard: it appears to be a combinatorial optimization problem. Even integer programming is np hard, and our objective is nonlinear (although it is monotonic). We may be able to get somewhere by relaxing integrality and replacing the step function for the score with a sigmoid-esque function, allowing for gradient-based optimization.\n",
